1.       Please revise head title to:
2016 – 2017 | 19 Divisions | 61 Nations
-->
<!-- 2.       The font colour of the header looks grey. The colour of the existing map is black. Can we do black please. -->

<!-- 3.       You spelt New Zealand wrong (please add the ‘a’ in) -->

<!-- 4.       New Zealand’s Total should be 3 -->

		This is a french island
5.       A little island above New Zealand when you hover over it lights up as France.

<!-- 6.       Hematology should not be spelt with an ‘a’ in it. Sorry, but this will go for all countries that have it listed in it -->

<!-- 27.   In Brazil, list the divisions in alphabetical order -->

<!-- 28.   In Jamaica, change Respiratory Therapy to Respiratory Medicine -->

<!-- 29.   Mexico’s total should be 3 -->

  You dont need to zoom in ... you just hover over the area with the tip of the mouse and it recognized the country youre trying to read out
33.   For the smaller countries, the only reason I am was able to see them was when I zoomed in A LOT (ie. Kuwait, Jamaica, etc…). Are we able to make the small ones bigger so people can hover over to see it?


  This will be worked on yes ... it would be exactly like last years in formating
34.   Was also maybe thinking: When we have the rotating country at the top under the header, would we have Total Fellows: ____ | (then the rotating country). This way, people have a comparison?

  This can be taken off but it would help people who dont know whats going on understand what the map means
35.   Is the Legend there just got now? I don’t think we will need that in the end..

2.       I also like where you placed the title on the current map (stretching across Greenland to Russia). Can we do that again?
<!-- 3.       Syria is not listed in alphabetical order -->
<!-- 4.       Israel is not listed in alphabetical order -->
<!-- 5.       Israel total is listed as Total: 2 when it should read Total: 25 -->
<!-- 6.       Italy you have it listed as Respiratory Therapy. It should read Respiratory Medicine -->
<!-- 7.       Greece is not listed in alphabetical order -->
<!-- 8.       Italy is not listed in alphabetical order -->
<!-- 9.       Switzerland you have it listed as Respiratory Therapy. It should read Respiratory Medicine -->
10.  Was also maybe thinking: When we have the rotating country at the top under the header, would we have Total Fellows: ____ | 				(then the rotating country). This way, people have a comparison?
        	This will be worked on yes ... it would be exactly like last years in formatting
          Not like last years. Last years doesn’t have the grand total of fellows. Under the head title I would want Total Fellows: 452 (or whatever the number was) locked in | (then the rotating country or whatever the country that is being hovered over)
11.  Is the Legend there just got now? I don’t think we will need that in the end..
          This can be taken off but it would help people who dont know whats going on understand what the map means
        	Please remove legend. I’m sure people will understand that if it’s not coloured in or has information pop up that it means there was no trainees from that country.
